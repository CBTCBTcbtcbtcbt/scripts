A half-buried underwater acoustic pinger is gated behind a narrow passage formed by concrete tetrapods and a muddy seafloor ridge. High turbidity silt suspension creates heavy particulate backscatter and a strong Tyndall effect. Environment is a hypoxic grey zone with severe depth-dependent color attenuation and chromatic aberration at the frame edges."

Chromatic aberration is visible in the corners."
