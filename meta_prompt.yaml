    "user_prompt": "**Task:** Generate exactly 20 unique and highly diversified Stable Diffusion Prompts for underwater scenes. These prompts must be suitable for AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) navigation tasks. **Variable Elements (Combine these elements randomly):**      | Variable Category | Element List |        | :--- | :--- |        | **Target (T):** | [Red buoy, Ancient stone pillar, Lost submarine, Submarine pipeline section, Glowing deep-sea vent] |        | **Obstacle (O):** | [Dense kelp forest, Sunken car wreck, Wall of volcanic rock, Massive brain coral, Abandoned fishing nets] |        | **Environment (E):** | [Deep blue water, Tropical shallow water, Murky visibility, Strong sunlight caustics, Bioluminescent algae, Green-tinted water] |        **Fixed Elements & Style Rules (MUST be included in every Prompt):*        1. **Viewpoint (V):** Every prompt must be generated from a **First-person AUV view** using a **wide-angle lens** with **slight lens distortion**.       2. **Style (S):** The style must be **photorealistic**, using an **underwater photography style**, with **volumetric light**, **subtle haze**, and **retaining the classic blue-green filtering**. (Crucially, avoid adding '8K' or 'ultra clear' to meet the requirement of *retaining the underwater style*.)        **Strict Generation Rules:**       1. **Unique Combination:** Every single Prompt must be unique.        2. **Navigation Intent:** The Prompt must explicitly describe the **relative positional relationship** between the **Target (T)** and the **Obstacle (O)** to imply a navigation path (e.g., 'The target is located **behind** the obstacle,' 'The path must be taken through the O's **left side**').        3. **Negatives:** For every Prompt, generate a corresponding, unique set of **Negative Prompts** focused on avoiding failures like **low quality, excessive clarity, warm colors, artifacts, text, or being too close to the surface**.       **Output Format Structure:**        ```json        [        {            'id': 1,            'prompt': '...',            'negative_prompt': '..'    },    ... (continue up to id 10)    ]"
